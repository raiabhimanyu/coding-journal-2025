# 🔢 Bagels - A Deductive Logic Game

**Bagels** is a number guessing game that challenges your deductive reasoning skills.  
You must guess a secret 3-digit number using clues like **Pico**, **Fermi**, and **Bagels** — but you only get 10 tries!

Inspired by the original version by [Al Sweigart](https://inventwithpython.com), this version is coded in Python as part of my learning journey.

## 🎮 Gameplay Rules

- The computer generates a random 3-digit number with **no repeating digits**.
- You have **10 guesses** to find the correct number.
- After each guess, the game gives clues:

| Clue   | Meaning                                      |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| Fermi  | One digit is correct and in the right place |
| Pico   | One digit is correct but in the wrong place |
| Bagels | No digit is correct                          |

The order of clues does not match the order of the digits.
